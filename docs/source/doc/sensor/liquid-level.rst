Measuring Liquid Level
======================


eTape Liquid Level Sensor
=========================

The eTape Liquid Level Sensor is a solid-state sensor with a resistive output
that varies with the level of the fluid. It does away with clunky mechanical
floats, and easily interfaces with electronic control systems. The eTape
sensor's envelope is compressed by the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid in
which it is immersed. This results in a change in resistance that corresponds
to the distance from the top of the sensor to the surface of the fluid. The
sensor's resistive output is inversely proportional to the height of the
liquid: the lower the liquid level, the higher the output resistance; the
higher the liquid level, the lower the output resistance.

This is a very unique sensor, we haven't seen anything else that is affordable
and accurate for measuring liquid level. This sensor seems like it would be a
handy addition to an hydroponics, aquarium, fountain or pool controller, or
perhaps measuring a rain tube.

SainSmart Water Sensor
======================

Water sensor brick is designed for water detection, which can be widely used
in sensing the rainfall, water level, even the liquate leakage. The brick is
mainly comprised of three parts: An Electronic brick connector, a 1 MΩ
resistor, and several lines of bare conducting wires.
